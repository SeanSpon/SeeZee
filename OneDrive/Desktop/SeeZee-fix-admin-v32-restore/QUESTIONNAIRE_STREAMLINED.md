# Questionnaire Flow Streamlined ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Contact Form Step**
- Users have accounts, so no need for separate contact form
- Flow reduced from 4 steps to 3 steps:
  - **Step 0**: Package Selection
  - **Step 1**: Questionnaire (12 questions one-at-a-time)
  - **Step 2**: Review & Submit

### 2. **Updated Progress Bar**
- Changed from 4 steps to 3 steps
- Labels: Package → Questions → Review
- Removed "Contact" step entirely

### 3. **Submit Flow Changes**
- ✅ Submits lead to database
- ✅ Resets questionnaire store (clears all filled data)
- ✅ Redirects directly to `/client` dashboard
- ✅ User can see their submitted quote in the client dashboard
- ❌ Removed success/receipt page (unnecessary intermediate step)

### 4. **Questionnaire Component Updates**
- "Continue to Contact" button → "Continue to Review" button
- Properly validates all required questions before allowing continuation
- Added "Start Over" button in bottom-left navigation

### 5. **Visual Improvements**
- Removed black backgrounds (`bg-black/40`, `bg-black/80`)
- Changed to transparent glass effect (`bg-white/5`, `backdrop-blur-sm`)
- Global.css animated background now visible throughout
- Text has drop shadows for readability over animated background
- Progress bar uses subtle backdrop blur instead of solid black

### 6. **Review Page Updates**
- Removed contact information display section
- Added "Account Information" message explaining quote will be linked to their account
- User can view/manage quote in client dashboard after submission

## User Flow

1. **Start at `/start`** - Select package
2. **Answer 12 questions** - One at a time with progress tracking
3. **Review everything** - See package, features, pricing, totals
4. **Submit quote** - Redirected to `/client` to view submitted lead
5. **Fresh start** - Questionnaire data cleared for next quote

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/app/(public)/start/page.tsx` - Main flow logic, removed contact step, direct redirect to /client
- `src/components/qwiz/QuestionnaireForm.tsx` - Updated button text and navigation
- `src/lib/qwiz/store.ts` - Already had reset() function (no changes needed)

### State Management
- `useQwizStore.getState().reset()` called after successful submission
- Clears all questionnaire data, package selection, features, totals
- Ready for next quote request

### Validation
- Package must be selected (Step 0)
- All 6 required questions must be answered (Step 1):
  - goals
  - industry
  - targetAudience
  - contentStatus
  - timeline
  - existingWebsite
- Review step always ready (Step 2)
