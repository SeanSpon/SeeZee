# ✅ Client Dashboard Complete + TOS Loop Fixed

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Client Dashboard Structure Created
- **Layout**: `/client/layout.tsx` - Full sidebar navigation + topbar
- **Sidebar**: Beautiful dark-glass theme with navigation to all client pages
- **Overview Page**: KPI cards, timeline, invoice table (placeholders for now)
- **Components**: 
  - `KpiCard.tsx` - Metric display cards
  - `Timeline.tsx` - Activity timeline
  - `InvoiceTable.tsx` - Invoice list table

### 2. ✅ TOS Loop FIXED
**Problem**: CEO was being redirected to TOS even after completing onboarding

**Root Cause**: 
```typescript
const needsProfile = !user.profileDoneAt;  // ❌ Wrong logic
```

This checked if profile was NOT done, regardless of TOS status.

**Fix**:
```typescript
const needsProfile = user.tosAcceptedAt && !user.profileDoneAt;  // ✅ Correct
```

Now profile onboarding only triggers if TOS is complete but profile is not.

**Result**: You'll never be redirected to TOS again if you've already completed it! 🎉

## Client Dashboard Routes Created

```
/client                    → Overview (KPIs, timeline, invoices)
/client/projects           → Project list (TODO)
/client/projects/[id]      → Project detail (TODO)
/client/progress           → Cross-project progress (TODO)
/client/messages           → Chat (TODO)
/client/github             → GitHub activity + AI explanations (TODO)
/client/invoices           → Invoice list (TODO)
/client/files              → Files & assets (TODO)
/client/requests           → Change requests (TODO)
/client/settings           → Profile settings (TODO)

```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Now
1. **Client Dashboard Layout** - Sidebar + topbar rendering
2. **Overview Page** - Showing placeholder KPI cards
3. **TOS Loop Fixed** - CEO won't be redirected to onboarding anymore
4. **RBAC Working** - Only CLIENT users can access `/client/**`

### 📋 TODO (Next Steps)
1. Create remaining client pages (projects, messages, etc.)
2. Add real Prisma queries to fetch client data
3. Build API endpoints for client interactions
4. Add GitHub integration placeholders
5. Create chat/messaging system

---

## Testing

1. **Sign in as CEO** (seanspm1007@gmail.com)
   - ✅ Should go to `/admin` (not TOS)
   - ✅ Should stay on admin pages

2. **Sign in as CLIENT**
   - ✅ Should go to `/client` after onboarding
   - ✅ Should see client dashboard with sidebar
   - ✅ Trying to access `/admin` redirects to `/client`

3. **New User**
   - ✅ Should see TOS → Profile → Dashboard flow
   - ✅ Once complete, never see onboarding again

1. **Build all remaining client pages** (projects, messages, invoices, etc.)
2. **Add real Prisma queries** to fetch actual data
3. **Create API endpoints** for client interactions
4. **Build the messaging system**
5. **Add file upload/download**

Or focus on something else? Let me know! 🚀
