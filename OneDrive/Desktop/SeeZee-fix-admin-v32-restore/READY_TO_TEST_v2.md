# 🚀 Ready to Test - Complete Pricing Overhaul

## ✅ What We Just Did

### 1. Fixed Particles Animation (Forever!)
Your particles were getting stuck in the footer because they were using `z-index: -1` which put them *behind* the body background. 

**The Fix**:
- Particles now at `z-index: 0` (sits behind content but above body)
- Main content wrapper at `z-index: 10` (sits above particles)
- Footer already has `bg-slate-900/80 backdrop-blur-xl` (particles show through!)
- Animation now goes from `110vh` → `-10vh` (full screen coverage)
- Added fade in/out at edges for smooth appearance

**Result**: Particles flow smoothly across the entire page, visible behind all content, never get stuck!
