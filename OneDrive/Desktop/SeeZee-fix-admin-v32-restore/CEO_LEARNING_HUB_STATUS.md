## üìù Implementation Notes

### Audience Expansion Logic
When CEO assigns training:
1. **USER**: Direct assignment to specified user IDs
2. **TEAM**: Queries `OrganizationMember` to get all `userId`s for the team
3. **ROLE**: Queries `User` model to get all users with specified `UserRole`

For each expanded user:
- Creates `Assignment` record with `audienceType`, `userId`, optional `teamId`/`role`
- Creates `Completion` record with `status: NOT_STARTED`
- Skips if assignment already exists

### Completion Status Flow
1. **NOT_STARTED** - Initial state when assigned
2. **IN_PROGRESS** - User clicks "Start" (sets `startedAt`)
3. **COMPLETE** - User clicks "Complete" or CEO marks complete (sets `completedAt`)

### Data Model Relationships
```
Training (1) ‚Üí (N) Assignment (1) ‚Üí (N) Completion (N) ‚Üê (1) User
Resource (1) ‚Üí (N) CreatedBy (User)
ToolEntry (standalone)
Assignment (N) ‚Üê (1) CreatedBy (User)
```
