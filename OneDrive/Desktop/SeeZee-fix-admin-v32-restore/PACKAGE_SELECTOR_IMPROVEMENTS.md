# Package Selector Improvements ✨

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Selection Not Advancing
**Problem**: Clicking "Select Package" button did nothing  
**Root Cause**: Imports using `store-new` and `pricing-new` instead of renamed files  
**Solution**: 
- Updated `PackageSelector.tsx` to import from `@/lib/qwiz/store`
- Updated `PackageSelector.tsx` to import from `@/lib/qwiz/pricing`
- Updated `FeatureBuilder.tsx` to use correct imports

**Result**: ✅ Package selection now properly calls `setStep(1)` and advances

---

### 2. Poor Feature Visibility
**Problem**: Only showing 4-5 features with generic names like "brand-identity"  
**Root Cause**: Not using actual feature data from `getFeature()`  
**Solution**: 
- Now displays `feature.title` instead of `featureId.replace(/-/g, ' ')`
- Shows actual feature names like "Logo & Brand Colors" instead of "brand identity"
- Added feature count badge showing total included features
- Shows up to 5 features with "+ X more features" link

**Result**: ✅ Much clearer value proposition

---

### 3. Weak Purchase Influence
**Problem**: Hard to compare packages, no visual comparison, unclear value  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive comparison features

---
