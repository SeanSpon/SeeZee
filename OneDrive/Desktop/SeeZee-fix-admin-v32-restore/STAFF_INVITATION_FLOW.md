# Staff Invitation Flow

## Overview
The staff invitation system allows the CEO to invite team members who will be automatically upgraded to STAFF accounts with assigned roles when they sign in with Google.

## Flow Steps

### 1. CEO Creates Invitation
1. Navigate to `/admin/team`
2. Click "Invite Staff" button (CEO-only)
3. Enter staff member's email and select their role:
   - ADMIN
   - DESIGNER
   - DEV (Developer)
   - OUTREACH
   - INTERN
   - STAFF
4. Click "Create Invitation"

### 2. Get Manual Sharing Link
- After creating the invitation, a unique link is generated
- Format: `http://localhost:3000/join?token=XXXXX`
- **Copy the link** using the "üìã Copy Link to Clipboard" button
- **Email this link** to the staff member manually

### 3. Staff Member Receives Link
- Staff member receives email with invitation link
- Link expires in 7 days
- Can only be used once

### 4. Staff Member Joins
1. Click the invitation link ‚Üí redirects to `/join?token=XXXXX`
2. Page validates the token and shows:
   - ‚úÖ Valid invitation
   - Email address they were invited with
   - Role they'll be assigned
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. **IMPORTANT**: Must sign in with the EXACT email that was invited

### 5. Auto-Upgrade Process
After Google sign-in, the system automatically:
1. Verifies the Google email matches the invited email
2. Upgrades the user account:
   - `accountType` ‚Üí `STAFF`
   - `role` ‚Üí Assigned role (ADMIN, DEV, etc.)
   - `tosAcceptedAt` ‚Üí Current timestamp (skips onboarding)
   - `profileDoneAt` ‚Üí Current timestamp (skips profile setup)
3. Marks the invitation as redeemed
4. Forces re-authentication to refresh the JWT token
5. Redirects to `/login` with success message

### 6. Staff Member Access
- After re-signing in, staff member has full access to:
  - `/admin` dashboard (STAFF-only areas)
  - Their assigned role permissions
  - No onboarding screens (automatically skipped)
