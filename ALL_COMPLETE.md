## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### ✅ 1. Fixed Particles Animation
- **Problem**: Particles getting stuck in footer, wrong z-index
- **Solution**: 
  - Particles container at `z-index: 0` (behind content)
  - Main content at `z-index: 10` (above particles)
  - Animation from `110vh` → `-10vh` (full coverage)
  - Moved long background image URL to inline `style` attribute
  - ClientAnimations now creates particles in `#particles` div
- **Result**: Smooth flowing particles behind all content ✨
