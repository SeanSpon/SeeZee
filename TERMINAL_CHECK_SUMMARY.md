# Terminal Error Check Summary
**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **All Clear - No Errors**

## System Status

### Dev Server
```
✓ Next.js 15.0.3
✓ Local: http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in 1508ms
```

## Errors Fixed

### 1. ❌ Team Page Error (FIXED)
**Problem**: `/admin/team` page was calling `prisma.invitation.findMany()` - the old model that was replaced.

**File**: `src/app/(admin)/admin/team/page.tsx` (line 36)

**Fix**: 
```typescript
// OLD (broken)
return await prisma.invitation.findMany({ ... })

// NEW (working)
return await prisma.staffInviteCode.findMany({ ... })
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and working

### 2. ⚠️ Email Configuration (PENDING)
**Problem**: Email sending fails with `Missing credentials for "PLAIN"`

**Error**:
```
Invitation creation error: [Error: Missing credentials for "PLAIN"] {
  code: 'EAUTH',
  command: 'API'
}
```

**Cause**: Environment variables `EMAIL_FROM` and `EMAIL_PASS` are not set.

**Fix Added to `.env.local`**:
```env
# Email (for staff invitations - 6-digit codes)
EMAIL_FROM=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password-here
```

**Action Required**:
1. Replace `your-gmail@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address
2. Generate a Gmail App Password:
   - Go to Google Account → Security
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication
   - Go to "App Passwords"
   - Generate new app password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password
3. Replace `your-app-password-here` with the generated password
4. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**Status**: ⚠️ **Requires manual configuration**

## System Architecture

### 6-Digit Code System (Implemented)
✅ Database model: `StaffInviteCode` (replaced `Invitation`)  
✅ Email infrastructure: `src/lib/mailer.ts`  
✅ Code generation API: `/api/invitations/code`  
✅ Code verification API: `/api/onboarding/verify-code`  
✅ Account type selection: `/api/onboarding/account-type`  
✅ UI components: InviteStaffButton, 6-digit OTP input  
✅ Security: Bcrypt hashing, rate limiting (5 attempts), 7-day expiration  
✅ Prisma client: Regenerated with `npx prisma generate`  

### Email Flow (Once configured)
1. CEO clicks "Invite Staff" at `/admin/team`
2. System generates random 6-digit code (000000-999999)
3. Code hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
4. Record created in `staff_invite_codes` table
5. Automated email sent via Gmail SMTP with code
6. Worker receives email, clicks sign-in button
7. Worker selects "Worker" account type
8. System prompts for 6-digit code
9. Worker enters code → verification API validates
10. On success: User upgraded to STAFF with assigned role
11. System logs event, redirects to fresh sign-in

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Prisma schema updated
- [x] Migration applied successfully
- [x] Prisma client regenerated
- [x] Team page fixed to use new model
- [x] Dev server starts without errors
- [x] Environment variables template added

### ⚠️ Pending (Requires Email Config)
- [ ] Configure EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_PASS
- [ ] Test email sending (CEO invites staff)
- [ ] Test email receipt (check inbox)
- [ ] Test code entry (Worker onboarding)
- [ ] Test code validation (success case)
- [ ] Test invalid codes (rate limiting)
- [ ] Test expired codes (7-day expiration)
- [ ] Verify user upgrade (CLIENT → STAFF)
- [ ] Check SystemLog entries (audit trail)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Testing)
1. **Configure Email Credentials** (see instructions above)
2. Restart dev server after configuration
3. Test invitation flow end-to-end

### Future Features (Per Todo List)
1. **Settings → Profile Editor** (next todo)
   - Create `/settings/profile` page
   - Edit name, phone, company fields
   - Post-onboarding profile updates

2. **Credentials Provider** (future)
   - Add username/password auth
   - Bcrypt password hashing
   - Link to existing Google accounts
   - UserCredential model in database
   - `/settings/security` page

## Documentation

Full system documentation available in:
- **`SIX_DIGIT_CODE_SYSTEM.md`** - Complete 6-digit code system reference

---

## Summary

**All compilation/runtime errors fixed! ✅**

The 6-digit staff invitation code system is fully implemented and the dev server runs cleanly. The only remaining step is to configure the Gmail credentials to enable email sending.

System is ready for testing once EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_PASS are configured.
