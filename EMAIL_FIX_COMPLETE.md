# ✅ EMAIL SYSTEM FIXED - Resend Integration Complete

## Summary

**Problem:** Gmail authentication failing with 500 errors  
**Solution:** Switched from Gmail/nodemailer to Resend API  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - Ready to test!**

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated `src/lib/mailer.ts`
- ❌ **Removed:** nodemailer with Gmail authentication
- ✅ **Added:** Resend API integration
- ✅ **Result:** Simpler, more reliable email sending

### 2. Cleaned Up `.env.local`
- ❌ **Removed:** `EMAIL_FROM` and `EMAIL_PASS` (Gmail credentials)
- ✅ **Using:** `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- ✅ **Consolidated:** Removed duplicate Resend vars

### 3. Package Installation
- ✅ Resend package already installed
- ✅ No additional dependencies needed

---

## Current Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
```env
# Email (Resend - for staff invitations with 6-digit codes)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_9twxr144_L2ivtd4jBx1paEcKAQ8KuRAn
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@seezee.studio
```

✅ **Both variables are set correctly!**

---

## How to Test

### 1. Go to Team Page
```
http://localhost:3000/admin/team
```

### 2. Click "Invite Staff"
- Enter email: `your-test-email@gmail.com`
- Select role: `DESIGNER` (or any role)
- Click "Send Invitation"

### 3. Expected Result
**Success Message:**
```
✅ Invitation email sent to your-test-email@gmail.com! 
   They'll receive a 6-digit code.
```

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ 6-digit code generated (e.g., `123456`)
2. ✅ Code hashed with bcrypt and stored in database
3. ✅ Email sent via Resend API
4. ✅ SystemLog entry created (`invite_create`)

### 4. Check Email
**Inbox:** Look for email from `SeeZee Team <noreply@seezee.studio>`  
**Subject:** "Your SeeZee Worker Invitation"  
**Content:**
- Beautiful gradient design
- Large 6-digit code in monospace font
- "Sign In with Google" button
- Instructions for joining
- Expiration date (7 days)

## What If Domain Not Verified?

If `seezee.studio` is not verified in Resend, you might see an error.

**Quick Fix - Use Resend Sandbox:**
1. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
   ```
2. Restart dev server: Stop with Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`
3. Test again

**Long-term Solution:**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add `seezee.studio` domain
3. Follow DNS verification steps
4. Once verified, switch back to `noreply@seezee.studio`

---

## Debugging

### Check Terminal for Errors
If you see errors in the terminal, look for:

**Resend API Error:**
```
Invitation creation error: { message: "Domain not verified" }
```
→ Solution: Use `onboarding@resend.dev`

**Missing API Key:**
```
Invitation creation error: { message: "API key is required" }
```
→ Solution: Check `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.local`

### Check Resend Dashboard
1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. See all sent emails
3. Check delivery status
4. View email preview

---

## Full Invitation Flow (End-to-End)

### For CEO (You):
1. Go to `/admin/team`
2. Click "Invite Staff"
3. Enter email: `worker@example.com`
4. Select role: `DESIGNER`
5. Click "Send Invitation"
6. ✅ See success message
7. ✅ Check SystemLog for `invite_create` entry

### For Worker (Invited User):
1. ✅ Receives email with 6-digit code (e.g., `123456`)
2. Clicks "Sign In with Google"
3. Signs in with Google account
4. Sees "Choose Account Type" screen
5. Clicks "Worker" card
6. ✅ Sees 6-digit code input boxes
7. Enters code: `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6`
8. Clicks "Verify Code"
9. ✅ System validates code with bcrypt
10. ✅ User upgraded from CLIENT → STAFF
11. ✅ Role set to DESIGNER
12. ✅ SystemLog entry created (`invite_redeem`)
13. ✅ Redirected to signout → fresh JWT
14. ✅ Next login shows STAFF dashboard

## Security Features (Still Active)

- ✅ **Bcrypt hashing** - 6-digit codes never stored in plain text
- ✅ **Rate limiting** - Max 5 attempts per code
- ✅ **Expiration** - Codes expire after 7 days
- ✅ **One-time use** - Code becomes invalid after redemption
- ✅ **Audit logging** - All events tracked in SystemLog
- ✅ **Email matching** - Code only works for invited email

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/lib/mailer.ts` - Switched to Resend API
2. ✅ `.env.local` - Cleaned up email variables
3. ✅ No changes to API routes or UI components

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Test the invitation system** (follow steps above)
2. **Verify email delivery** (check inbox or Resend dashboard)
3. **Confirm no terminal errors** (should see clean 200 responses)

### After Testing:
1. ✅ Move to next todo: **Settings → Profile Editor**
2. Create `/settings/profile` page
3. Allow users to edit name, phone, company fields
