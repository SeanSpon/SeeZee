## üìù Schema Notes

The client dashboard uses these relationships:
- **Projects**: Accessed via `project.lead.email = session.user.email`
- **Invoices**: Accessed via `invoice.project.lead.email = session.user.email`
- **Milestones**: Direct relationship to projects
- **Files**: Associated with projects

Missing from schema but designed for:
- Messages/Chat (needs ChatMessage filtered by client)
- Change Requests (could use existing Inquiry or new model)
- GitHub Activity (needs integration)
